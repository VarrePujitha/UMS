The College Management System is a beginner-friendly Python command-line application designed to efficiently manage colleges along with their students and teachers using object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and class hierarchy. The system features four primary classes: Person, which contains common attributes like roll number and name; Student, inheriting from Person and adding a branch; Teacher, also inheriting from Person and adding a subject; and College, which maintains a unique college name along with lists of students and teachers and provides methods to add and display them. The application presents a user-friendly, menu-driven interface where users can create new colleges (avoiding duplicates), add students and teachers to specific colleges, and view student or teacher lists, all through interactive prompts. The program runs in a continuous loop until the user chooses to exit, allowing seamless multi-college data management during a session. It is purely in-memory and does not require external libraries, making it easy to run by simply saving the script as college_management.py and executing it with Python. This project is ideal for academic demonstrations, learning OOP concepts, or building small-scale educational management prototypes. Future enhancements could include persistent storage using files or databases, GUI integration using Tkinter or web development using Flask or Django, user authentication, record search and update features, and report generation tools. The project is open-source, licensed under the MIT License, and welcomes contributions from developers who wish to extend its capabilities or adapt it for their own learning or academic purposes. Created with simplicity and clarity in mind, itâ€™s a great foundational project for anyone exploring real-world applications of Python programming.
